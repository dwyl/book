and people who don't _make_ the time to _learn/practice_ are _destined for disappointment_.

## _Why_ Should _Anyone_ Learn How to Build Web Apps _Today_?

Think/say what you like about Steve,
he was _right_ about (_at least_) one thing:

![steve jobs learn how to code!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953417/2bb48e3c-da2e-11e6-8ae9-2a46fa6e2a7d.png)

Considering that there are
[_millions_ of "Apps"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/)
_already_, why should I (_or anyone for that matter_) bother
learning how to make _more_ of them?

This is a _great_ question and one we ask _ourselves_
[@dwyl](https://twitter.com/dwyl) _often_!  
The _answer_ is _another_ question: do you think _all_ the world's
problems/challenges have been _resolved_...?
To which the _answer_ is: ***not even close!***

> Someone _recently_ asked: "_Is software engineering a **dead end** career?_"  
https://www.quora.com/Is-software-engineering-a-dead-end-career

It's `true` (_logical_) that ***eventually*** there _will_ be
["_enough_ apps"](http://valleywag.gawker.com/there-are-officially-too-many-apps-and-nobody-is-makin-1611128750)
to _achieve_ "***all the things***" we need, but "_experts_" have
been [_predicting_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11974922)
the ["_end of software_"]() for the last 20 years.
And yet, the _pace_ of change _continues_ to _accelerate_ and
the number of _jobs_ that aren't being filled because
the "***skills shortage***" has ***increased sharply*** in recent years:

For the _foreseeable future_ creating web applications
with the tools/techniques outlined in this book will be a "_thing_".

### What's "In It" For _Me_?

Our "_podium_" list of what ***you*** will _gain_ by learning this "_content_":

1. The ***vocabulary*** to have **technical discussions** with web developers
(_without sounding like a ["**poser**"](https://youtu.be/nB2ngWWhxEk?t=3m49s)
which is **not** the same as a ["**beginner**"](https://youtu.be/kKO3dXiTl1s) ..._)
even if you decide not be a full-time coder, if you know _how_ to code,
you will have a _far_ more fruitful time working with technical people.
2. A chance to Meet & collaborate with ***interesting people*** on using
technology to make the world a better place for everyone!
3. (_last but not least_) The "***skills*** _to pay the bills_"
which will let you build your _own_ ideas
or get paid (_really well_) to work on a challenge with an _existing_ team.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21952954/abe46f48-da22-11e6-97c2-4864316ceb56.png)

As with _any_ skill, your coding skills are  whatever you `make` of them!


## _Why_ Write a "_Book_"?

The `main` reason we decided to organize our knowledge/experience as a "_book_"
is because people were _using_ (_and loving_) our tutorials _individually_.

[![people-find-dwyl-tutorials-useful](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953434/b44b311a-da2e-11e6-9675-e4af89bb8eaa.png)](https://twitter.com/dwylhq/status/775016209263845377)

but people _kept asking_ us:

> **Question**: "_Is there an **order** in which I
should follow your tutorials_...?" <br />
> **Answer**: ***Yes***!

So we wanted to present our _series_ of tutorials in a _reasonably_ systematic/linear
format that anyone can follow in an _order_.

The reasons we did not _state_ the order of learning `before` were that:
+ the _sheer number_ of "_things_" to learn would have overwhelmed _us_.
+ there were _so many_ "_gaps_" in our documentation that we would
have suffered from a _panic-induced "**blank page syndrome**" or writer's block_
and never got _started_!

We are _very_ conscious of the fact that there is a "_lot to learn_"
in order to build web applications.

By making individual self-contained tutorials we were able to "_chunk_"
the knowledge into parts that were relevant to people searching for
a guide specific to that subject.

The _second_ reason is to make it "_portable_". By grouping all of our
tutorials in a single PDF people can put it on their e-Reader and
read it "**AFK**" or even pipe it through a "screen reader"
and listen as an _Audio Book_!

> We wrote the _individual_ tutorials was out of _frustration_/_pain_
of working in organisations where knowledge was not distributed.
Count yourself _lucky_ if you have never worked at a company
where people "_hoard_" and "_guard_" their knowledge/skill/data/insight because
they think it will maintain their "_power_", "_position_" or "_influence_".
We @dwylhq have worked in _many_ such companies and grew weary of
the "_boss_" who kept "_secrets_" or the "_subject matter expert_"
that could not be fired even though they were killing team morale.
***Systematically sharing our knowledge*** is our way of avoiding that charade!


# *Who*?

## ~~Readers~~ Learners

Who _should_ read (_and practice_) this...?

If you are (_already_) learning (_or want to learn how_)
to build Web-based Applications (_that "**Work Everywhere**"_)
using Open Source, ***Free*** tools, this book
(_or its individual self-contained/standalone "chapters"_)
will be *relevant* to you. Our _aim_ is that the content is _useful_
to ***everyone writing code*** _at_ ***any level***, but we are
starting with a focus on "_complete beginner_" and will work our way
up to "_advanced_", answering _any_ question you have along the journey!

If _anyone_ tells you that learning to code is a bad idea,
just smile and think to yourself:

> "***Never mind what haters say,
ignore them till they fade away***"
~ [T.I. (Live Your Life)](https://youtu.be/koVHN6eO4Xg)


## Writers

Unlike _most_ other books written by *one* person or even handful of people,
and "_published_" (_printed_) in paper
`this` book has _**many contributors**_ and is _continuously_ evolving.

> “***Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much***” ~ Helen Keller

As such it is the
[***Wisdom of the crowd***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd).
So if you spot an issue/typo in the text/code or have a better idea
(_e.g. a simpler explanation for a topic/concept_),
_**please** post_ an [issue](https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues) (_thanks!_).


# *What*?

This book is a _collection_ of ***practical usage examples for tools
we use to build web apps***.  
We ***wish*** we had `this` content `before` we _started_ coding,
_instead_ we had to learn things the _hard(er)_ way
_making **lots** of "**mistakes**"..._

![never-made-any-mistatkes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953354/68d60342-da2c-11e6-8723-f1915ab90357.png)

We have learned from our mistakes and _documented_ most of them!
Hopefully it's ***useful*** to other people.

### What can we _Make_ with the Knowledge/Skills in the Book?

The knowledge/skills you will gain from learning/practicing
the content will allow you to build web-based applications (_that "**Work Everywhere**"_)
for *many* reasons including (to):

+ ***Connect & communicate*** with our friends, colleagues & communities
+ ***Record & share*** information, knowledge, news, events, etc.
+ **Manage** all aspects of our lives (calendars, task/time trackers,
  shopping/wish lists, etc.)
+ **Run** organisations/businesses (_Administration, Workflow & "Management" Apps_)
+ **Buy/sell** things (_E-Commerce_)
+ ***Have fun***! (_e.g. online games! augmented/virtual reality!_)

Most universities/schools (_still_) don't teach practical web skills
as the *foundation* for computer science / software engineering ...
there are a number of _reasons_ for this, but the primary reason is that
the learning institution's curriculum is calcified by inertia...

The result of people not learning "modern" web technologies at "school" is
the _majority_ of companies/organisations *still* lack skills so most apps suck!
We are "_fixing_" the "_problem_".

<!--
If you are _still_ not writing tests _**why not**_?
We _urge_ you to _read_ the *first* chapter ("_A Brief Introduction to TDD_") and decide for yourself if you _still_ think its "_too difficult_" or "_takes longer_".
-->

### "_Free_" and Open Source...?

Yes, the book is **100% _Free_ and _Open Source_**  on GitHub for anyone to
read and [contribute](#contribute) to!
We (*strongly*) believe that ***all learning materials*** should be
open and freely available to all (*not controlled or "monopolized" for profit*)!

There's no "_up sell_" or "_premium_" version of _any_ of our content.
Learning is not our "_business_" and we have no _intention_ of charging
for any of our _content_.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953835/78937bd6-da39-11e6-92a9-d18e79c5472d.png)

Some people are of the _opinion_ that:

> "_If you're **good at something**, **never do it** for **free**_."
~ The Joker (The Dark Knight)

We _disagree_.
</br>
<b>Education is the most powerful weapon</b>
</br></br>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0661/7423/files/inspire-blog-section.jpg?16519069034986191748"></img>
Obviously, putting together learning resources takes (_a lot of_) ***time***
and most people don't have a lot of "_free time_"...
But we prefer to think of our knowledge sharing as an _investment_
in our people/_team(s)_ that pays _handsomely_ (_and almost **immediately**_)
because it _systematically_ "_transfers knowledge_" which both
improves the _pace_ of our work and reduces "_risk_" for our customers!
Win-win-win-win!!

## What "Technology *Stack*" is Covered?

A "stack" is the term use to describe all the components involved in a web app.
The more comprehensive definition is:

>"In computing, a solution stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications. Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform.

> ... in a web application the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language."

A Typical Stack could include:

+ Linux/Unix as the ***Server*** Operating System (OS)
+ A ***Web Application Framework*** running on the server. Example frameworks include:
  + Ruby-on-Rails/Sinatra (Ruby),
  + Django (Python),
  + CodeIgniter/Symphony/Drupal (PHP),
  + Akka (Scala/Java),
  + Express.js/Meteor.js/[_**Hapi.js**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi)
  (JavaScript/Node.js), etc.
  + ***Phoenix***
+ A ***database*** to which the (web app) framework connects.
There are many databases (often referred to as "*data stores*"),
the most popular are:
  + SQL-Based: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
  + NoSQL: MongoDB, CouchDB,
  [_**RethinkDB**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-rethinkdb/), HBase, etc
  + Search: [_**ElasticSearch**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elasticsearch)
  + Key Value Store: [_**Redis**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redis), LevelDB
+ Browser-based interactivity (*often referred to as the* "***Client***"
*or* "***Front End***" *of the stack*)

The "Stack" we use is _evolving_ with the industry _innovation_.
Please see: https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/
and if you want to `#GetInvolved` in the discussion,
read and comment on the issues: https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues

### You Will Learn "_In Demand_" Tech Tools/Skills

You will learn 3 of the "Top 10" most popular technologies of 2016
(_which are still just as popular/relevant in 2017!_)

https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology
![stackoverflow-most-popular-technologies](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954032/a94f0128-da3e-11e6-95d4-64757a6175e7.png)

### _Most Wanted_ Programming Languages

_And_... we will _also_ cover three of the most "_Wanted_" (_i.e. in demand!_)
technology skills which are _dramatically_ improving people's productivity,
effectiveness and quality of output!

![stackoverflow-other-technologies](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954067/28e98638-da3f-11e6-9e2a-0b1b080a826a.png)
See: https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-other
(_Click on "Wanted" tab to see the list_!)

## "*Full-Stack*" JavaScript?

The term "*Full Stack*" Developer has been around for a while.
We like [@laurencegellert](https://twitter.com/laurencegellert)'s
explanation:

> "*a Full Stack Developer is someone with* ***familiarity in each layer***, ***if not mastery in many*** *and a* ***genuine interest in all software technology***."

We agree with [@peteryared](https://twitter.com/peteryared) that it's naive to expect *anyone* to be an "*expert*" in *every* aspect of our stack,
but we do think that by using ***JavaScript*** as the programming language for the server (Node.js), client (*take your pick of framework!*) and datastore
(*any of the NoSQL datastores which store JSON documents*), it's easier to go "full stack".

See: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/

### "*Front End*"?

There is ***one (programming) language*** that *all* web
browsers "understand": ***JavaScript***.  
As a result it is the _most popular programming language_
(_see StackOverflow survey results above_!)

Additionally you will need to know two other "languages": HTML and CSS ... but:

![stay calm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954158/cea1b17a-da41-11e6-9f0e-a73627125934.png)

The web browser or mobile device (displaying content in a "*web view*")
is referred to as the "*Front End*".

### "Back End"?

When people refer to the "Back End" of an app they are describing the
"*Web/Application Server*" component(s); don't worry, we will cover all of this
and it's surprisingly fun!


![front-end-back-end](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954171/039c705e-da42-11e6-93d8-7883f365e5fb.png)

There are *many* technologies/languages/frameworks you can use to write
your server. As stated above, for *simplicity* we prefer to use JavaScript
(*Node.js*) on the server to keep one programming language across the stack
and allow us to re-use view code for both server-side and client
hence the _expression_ "Full-Stack"!


## Test Driven Development?

This is where we _differ_ from almost _all_ the other "_beginner_" level books!
We believe in writing _automated_ tests for all aspects of your application.
So that is one of the _first_ things you will learn how to do!


## The Book is Not "Finished" Yet, Should I Start Reading It?

The answer is: ***it depends***.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better Apps ASAP,
then start *now*! If you prefer to wait till its "ready", please star the repo,
and come back later.

## Star the Project :star:

The _easiest_ way you can _contribute_ is
by "_starring_" this project on GitHub!
This will help you to "_bookmark_" the content so you can return to it.
But it will also help the people who "_follow_" you on GitHub to _discover_
that you find it _interesting_ or _useful_.

The _more_ people star and _share_ the project, the more possible contributors are able to understand the value of contributing and *open sourcing their knowledge*!

### Got Comments/Ideas/Suggestions/Issues ?

If you have any ideas, comments or suggestions,
please raise an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues


### Watching the Repo (*to receive ALL the updates!*)

If you want to receive ***ALL*** the updates,
you _can_ **Watch** the GitHub repository.
**Note**: you may get quite a few emails...
but if you are interested in building great quality software
the content should be relevant to you.


<!-- Should we *bother* with "LeanPub"...? see: https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues/64

### The Book is Open Source, Why is LeanPub Charging?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*[DRM-FREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Opposition_to_DRM)*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...

Don't worry, its not "freemium" ...

![freemium is not free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-freemium-not-really.jpg)

We are posting every word open on github, so if you don't *want or need* the Kindle or iBooks version, just read it online for *free*.

## Proceeds of Sale >> *South African Technology School*

***ALL*** the proceeds (*after LeanPub fees*) from the sale of this book will go into the #[**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/) fund for the ***South African Technology School***
we plan to *build* in **2016** in our quest to create (*well-paid +remote*) Tech Jobs in Africa!

## History (*[tl;dr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TL;DR)*)

I, [_**@nelsonic**_](https://github.com/nelsonic) started writing tutorials
on Test Driven Development (TDD) out of ***frustration***
when (_some individuals in_) my *then* team *complained*
that "_testing/TDD is 'hard' and takes too long..._".
It seemed *logical* to publish the tutorials as step-by-step guides on GitHub
(_as opposed to a company wiki or Google Docs which I had done before..._)
so that complete strangers could benefit from the learning
and submit ideas for improvement or requests for more detail via
[questions (issues)](https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues),
_updates_ or _corrections_ (_e.g. updating a link or fixing a typo!_)
in the form of GitHub Pull Requests.

A few (*hundred*) GitHub stars (_and encouraging feedback messages_) later,
we created a GitHub [_Community_](https://github.com/dwyl) (_Organisation_)
dedicated to curating coding
tutorials: https://github.com/dwyl (_which now has **many active members**_)
and _collaboratively building useful tools using code_
which _any_ organisation/school/business can use ***free of charge***!

All coding examples for this book are released as self-contained/standalone
tutorials so you can *selectively learn* a *specific* tool/technique/technology
and share *just* that one _byte_ of learning with your team
(_or that one **special person** in your life who you know has
  **infinite potential** but keeps making excuses to not get with the program!_)
