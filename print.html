<p>Our &quot;<em>podium</em>&quot; list of what <em><strong>you</strong></em> will <em>gain</em> by learning this &quot;<em>content</em>&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <em><strong>vocabulary</strong></em> to have <strong>technical discussions</strong> with web developers
(<em>without sounding like a <a href="https://youtu.be/nB2ngWWhxEk?t=3m49s">&quot;<strong>poser</strong>&quot;</a>
which is <strong>not</strong> the same as a <a href="https://youtu.be/kKO3dXiTl1s">&quot;<strong>beginner</strong>&quot;</a> ...</em>)
even if you decide not be a full-time coder, if you know <em>how</em> to code,
you will have a <em>far</em> more fruitful time working with technical people.</li>
<li>A chance to Meet &amp; collaborate with <em><strong>interesting people</strong></em> on using
technology to make the world a better place for everyone!</li>
<li>(<em>last but not least</em>) The &quot;<em><strong>skills</strong></em> <em>to pay the bills</em>&quot;
which will let you build your <em>own</em> ideas
or get paid (<em>really well</em>) to work on a challenge with an <em>existing</em> team.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21952954/abe46f48-da22-11e6-97c2-4864316ceb56.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>As with <em>any</em> skill, your coding skills are  whatever you <code>make</code> of them!</p>
<h2 id="why-write-a-book"><a class="header" href="#why-write-a-book"><em>Why</em> Write a &quot;<em>Book</em>&quot;?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>main</code> reason we decided to organize our knowledge/experience as a &quot;<em>book</em>&quot;
is because people were <em>using</em> (<em>and loving</em>) our tutorials <em>individually</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dwylhq/status/775016209263845377"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953434/b44b311a-da2e-11e6-9675-e4af89bb8eaa.png" alt="people-find-dwyl-tutorials-useful" /></a></p>
<p>but people <em>kept asking</em> us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: &quot;<em>Is there an <strong>order</strong> in which I
should follow your tutorials</em>...?&quot; <br />
<strong>Answer</strong>: <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we wanted to present our <em>series</em> of tutorials in a <em>reasonably</em> systematic/linear
format that anyone can follow in an <em>order</em>.</p>
<p>The reasons we did not <em>state</em> the order of learning <code>before</code> were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>sheer number</em> of &quot;<em>things</em>&quot; to learn would have overwhelmed <em>us</em>.</li>
<li>there were <em>so many</em> &quot;<em>gaps</em>&quot; in our documentation that we would
have suffered from a <em>panic-induced &quot;<strong>blank page syndrome</strong>&quot; or writer's block</em>
and never got <em>started</em>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are <em>very</em> conscious of the fact that there is a &quot;<em>lot to learn</em>&quot;
in order to build web applications.</p>
<p>By making individual self-contained tutorials we were able to &quot;<em>chunk</em>&quot;
the knowledge into parts that were relevant to people searching for
a guide specific to that subject.</p>
<p>The <em>second</em> reason is to make it &quot;<em>portable</em>&quot;. By grouping all of our
tutorials in a single PDF people can put it on their e-Reader and
read it &quot;<strong>AFK</strong>&quot; or even pipe it through a &quot;screen reader&quot;
and listen as an <em>Audio Book</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wrote the <em>individual</em> tutorials was out of <em>frustration</em>/<em>pain</em>
of working in organisations where knowledge was not distributed.
Count yourself <em>lucky</em> if you have never worked at a company
where people &quot;<em>hoard</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>guard</em>&quot; their knowledge/skill/data/insight because
they think it will maintain their &quot;<em>power</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>position</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>influence</em>&quot;.
We @dwylhq have worked in <em>many</em> such companies and grew weary of
the &quot;<em>boss</em>&quot; who kept &quot;<em>secrets</em>&quot; or the &quot;<em>subject matter expert</em>&quot;
that could not be fired even though they were killing team morale.
<em><strong>Systematically sharing our knowledge</strong></em> is our way of avoiding that charade!</p>

<p>If you are (<em>already</em>) learning (<em>or want to learn how</em>)
to build Web-based Applications (<em>that &quot;<strong>Work Everywhere</strong>&quot;</em>)
using Open Source, <em><strong>Free</strong></em> tools, this book
(<em>or its individual self-contained/standalone &quot;chapters&quot;</em>)
will be <em>relevant</em> to you. Our <em>aim</em> is that the content is <em>useful</em>

<h1 id="what"><a class="header" href="#what"><em>What</em>?</a></h1>
<p>This book is a <em>collection</em> of <em><strong>practical usage examples for tools
we use to build web apps</strong></em>.<br />
We <em><strong>wish</strong></em> we had <code>this</code> content <code>before</code> we <em>started</em> coding,
<em>instead</em> we had to learn things the <em>hard(er)</em> way
<em>making <strong>lots</strong> of &quot;<strong>mistakes</strong>&quot;...</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953354/68d60342-da2c-11e6-8723-f1915ab90357.png" alt="never-made-any-mistatkes" /></p>
<p>We have learned from our mistakes and <em>documented</em> most of them!
Hopefully it's <em><strong>useful</strong></em> to other people.</p>

<p>The knowledge/skills you will gain from learning/practicing
the content will allow you to build web-based applications (<em>that &quot;<strong>Work Everywhere</strong>&quot;</em>)
for <em>many</em> reasons including (to):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Connect &amp; communicate</strong></em> with our friends, colleagues &amp; communities</li>
<li><em><strong>Record &amp; share</strong></em> information, knowledge, news, events, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Manage</strong> all aspects of our lives (calendars, task/time trackers,
shopping/wish lists, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> organisations/businesses (<em>Administration, Workflow &amp; &quot;Management&quot; Apps</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Buy/sell</strong> things (<em>E-Commerce</em>)</li>
<li><em><strong>Have fun</strong></em>! (<em>e.g. online games! augmented/virtual reality!</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most universities/schools (<em>still</em>) don't teach practical web skills
as the <em>foundation</em> for computer science / software engineering ...
there are a number of <em>reasons</em> for this, but the primary reason is that
the learning institution's curriculum is calcified by inertia...</p>
<p>The result of people not learning &quot;modern&quot; web technologies at &quot;school&quot; is
the <em>majority</em> of companies/organisations <em>still</em> lack skills so most apps suck!
We are &quot;<em>fixing</em>&quot; the &quot;<em>problem</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes, the book is <strong>100% <em>Free</em> and <em>Open Source</em></strong>  on GitHub for anyone to
read and <a href="../index.html#contribute">contribute</a> to!
We (<em>strongly</em>) believe that <em><strong>all learning materials</strong></em> should be
open and freely available to all (<em>not controlled or &quot;monopolized&quot; for profit</em>)!</p>
<p>There's no &quot;<em>up sell</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>premium</em>&quot; version of <em>any</em> of our content.
Learning is not our &quot;<em>business</em>&quot; and we have no <em>intention</em> of charging
for any of our <em>content</em>.</p>

<p>Some people are of the <em>opinion</em> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>If you're <strong>good at something</strong>, <strong>never do it</strong> for <strong>free</strong></em>.&quot;
~ The Joker (The Dark Knight)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <em>disagree</em>.

<b>Education is the most powerful weapon</b>

Obviously, putting together learning resources takes (<em>a lot of</em>) <em><strong>time</strong></em>
and most people don't have a lot of &quot;<em>free time</em>&quot;...
But we prefer to think of our knowledge sharing as an <em>investment</em>
in our people/<em>team(s)</em> that pays <em>handsomely</em> (<em>and almost <strong>immediately</strong></em>)
because it <em>systematically</em> &quot;<em>transfers knowledge</em>&quot; which both
improves the <em>pace</em> of our work and reduces &quot;<em>risk</em>&quot; for our customers!

<h2 id="what-technology-stack-is-covered"><a class="header" href="#what-technology-stack-is-covered">What &quot;Technology <em>Stack</em>&quot; is Covered?</a></h2>
<p>A &quot;stack&quot; is the term use to describe all the components involved in a web app.
The more comprehensive definition is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In computing, a solution stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications. Applications are said to &quot;run on&quot; or &quot;run on top of&quot; the resulting platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>... in a web application the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Typical Stack could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux/Unix as the <em><strong>Server</strong></em> Operating System (OS)</li>
<li>A <em><strong>Web Application Framework</strong></em> running on the server. Example frameworks include:
<ul>
<li>Ruby-on-Rails/Sinatra (Ruby),</li>
<li>Django (Python),</li>
<li>CodeIgniter/Symphony/Drupal (PHP),</li>
<li>Akka (Scala/Java),</li>
<li>Express.js/Meteor.js/<a href="https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi"><em><strong>Hapi.js</strong></em></a>
(JavaScript/Node.js), etc.</li>
<li><em><strong>Phoenix</strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <em><strong>database</strong></em> to which the (web app) framework connects.
There are many databases (often referred to as &quot;<em>data stores</em>&quot;),
the most popular are:
<ul>
<li>SQL-Based: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB</li>
<li>NoSQL: MongoDB, CouchDB,
<a href="https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-rethinkdb/"><em><strong>RethinkDB</strong></em></a>, HBase, etc</li>
<li>Search: <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elasticsearch"><em><strong>ElasticSearch</strong></em></a></li>
<li>Key Value Store: <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redis"><em><strong>Redis</strong></em></a>, LevelDB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser-based interactivity (<em>often referred to as the</em> &quot;<em><strong>Client</strong></em>&quot;
<em>or</em> &quot;<em><strong>Front End</strong></em>&quot; <em>of the stack</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;Stack&quot; we use is <em>evolving</em> with the industry <em>innovation</em>.

<h2 id="full-stack-javascript"><a class="header" href="#full-stack-javascript">&quot;<em>Full-Stack</em>&quot; JavaScript?</a></h2>
<p>The term &quot;<em>Full Stack</em>&quot; Developer has been around for a while.
We like <a href="https://twitter.com/laurencegellert">@laurencegellert</a>'s
explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>a Full Stack Developer is someone with</em> <em><strong>familiarity in each layer</strong></em>, <em><strong>if not mastery in many</strong></em> <em>and a</em> <em><strong>genuine interest in all software technology</strong></em>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/peteryared">@peteryared</a> that it's naive to expect <em>anyone</em> to be an &quot;<em>expert</em>&quot; in <em>every</em> aspect of our stack,
but we do think that by using <em><strong>JavaScript</strong></em> as the programming language for the server (Node.js), client (<em>take your pick of framework!</em>) and datastore
(<em>any of the NoSQL datastores which store JSON documents</em>), it's easier to go &quot;full stack&quot;.</p>
<p>See: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/</p>
<h3 id="front-end"><a class="header" href="#front-end">&quot;<em>Front End</em>&quot;?</a></h3>
<p>There is <em><strong>one (programming) language</strong></em> that <em>all</em> web
browsers &quot;understand&quot;: <em><strong>JavaScript</strong></em>.<br />
As a result it is the <em>most popular programming language</em>
(<em>see StackOverflow survey results above</em>!)</p>
<p>Additionally you will need to know two other &quot;languages&quot;: HTML and CSS ... but:</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954158/cea1b17a-da41-11e6-9f0e-a73627125934.png" alt="stay calm" /></p>
<p>The web browser or mobile device (displaying content in a &quot;<em>web view</em>&quot;)
is referred to as the &quot;<em>Front End</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="back-end"><a class="header" href="#back-end">&quot;Back End&quot;?</a></h3>
<p>When people refer to the &quot;Back End&quot; of an app they are describing the
&quot;<em>Web/Application Server</em>&quot; component(s); don't worry, we will cover all of this
and it's surprisingly fun!</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21954171/039c705e-da42-11e6-93d8-7883f365e5fb.png" alt="front-end-back-end" /></p>
<p>There are <em>many</em> technologies/languages/frameworks you can use to write
your server. As stated above, for <em>simplicity</em> we prefer to use JavaScript
(<em>Node.js</em>) on the server to keep one programming language across the stack
and allow us to re-use view code for both server-side and client
hence the <em>expression</em> &quot;Full-Stack&quot;!</p>
<h2 id="test-driven-development"><a class="header" href="#test-driven-development">Test Driven Development?</a></h2>
<p>This is where we <em>differ</em> from almost <em>all</em> the other &quot;<em>beginner</em>&quot; level books!
We believe in writing <em>automated</em> tests for all aspects of your application.
So that is one of the <em>first</em> things you will learn how to do!</p>

<p>The answer is: <em><strong>it depends</strong></em>.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better Apps ASAP,
then start <em>now</em>! If you prefer to wait till its &quot;ready&quot;, please star the repo,

### The Book is Open Source, Why is LeanPub Charging?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*[DRM-FREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Opposition_to_DRM)*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...

Don't worry, its not "freemium" ...

![freemium is not free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-freemium-not-really.jpg)

We are posting every word open on github, so if you don't *want or need* the Kindle or iBooks version, just read it online for *free*.

## Proceeds of Sale >> *South African Technology School*

***ALL*** the proceeds (*after LeanPub fees*) from the sale of this book will go into the #[**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/) fund for the ***South African Technology School***
we plan to *build* in **2016** in our quest to create (*well-paid +remote*) Tech Jobs in Africa!

If after watching [*this video*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zjh4d2p) you aren't inspired to get involved,
please let us know what *does* make you tick and we can donate the proceeds of your copy of the book to a different charity.

<h2 id="history-tldr"><a class="header" href="#history-tldr">History (<em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TL;DR">tl;dr</a></em>)</a></h2>
<p>I, <a href="https://github.com/nelsonic"><em><strong>@nelsonic</strong></em></a> started writing tutorials
on Test Driven Development (TDD) out of <em><strong>frustration</strong></em>
when (<em>some individuals in</em>) my <em>then</em> team <em>complained</em>
that &quot;<em>testing/TDD is 'hard' and takes too long...</em>&quot;.
It seemed <em>logical</em> to publish the tutorials as step-by-step guides on GitHub
(<em>as opposed to a company wiki or Google Docs which I had done before...</em>)
so that complete strangers could benefit from the learning
and submit ideas for improvement or requests for more detail via
<a href="https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues">questions (issues)</a>,
<em>updates</em> or <em>corrections</em> (<em>e.g. updating a link or fixing a typo!</em>)
in the form of GitHub Pull Requests.</p>
<p>A few (<em>hundred</em>) GitHub stars (<em>and encouraging feedback messages</em>) later,
we created a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/dwyl"><em>Community</em></a> (<em>Organisation</em>)
dedicated to curating coding
tutorials: https://github.com/dwyl (<em>which now has <strong>many active members</strong></em>)
and <em>collaboratively building useful tools using code</em>
which <em>any</em> organisation/school/business can use <em><strong>free of charge</strong></em>!</p>
<p>All coding examples for this book are released as self-contained/standalone
tutorials so you can <em>selectively learn</em> a <em>specific</em> tool/technique/technology
and share <em>just</em> that one <em>byte</em> of learning with your team
(<em>or that one <strong>special person</strong> in your life who you know has
<strong>infinite potential</strong> but keeps making excuses to not get with the program!</em>)</p>
