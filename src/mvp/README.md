# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

_All_ Apps start with an MVP. 
In our case we created a _separate_ repository:
[github.com/dwyl/**mvp**](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp)
so that the most _basic_ version of our `App` 
could be used as a reference by other people building MVPs.

# TODO: 

Lift the contents of 
[github.com/dwyl/mvp/BUILDIT.md](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp/blob/7c0a29cfe71582a9aada531af339afdd2734b809/BUILDIT.md?plain=1)
and split it into separate files here in `book`.
