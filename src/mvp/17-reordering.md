# Reordering `list_items`

The `people` who 
[tested](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp/issues/140)
the `MVP`
noted that the ability to **_organise_ their `items`**
as an **_essential_ feature**:
[dwyl/mvp#145](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp/issues/145)

With the addition of `lists`
we now have a way of _organising_ our `items`.
With the `position` field on a `list_items` record
we can reorder `items` on a `list`.  

> **Note**: There is quite a lot to cover in this chapter,
so we have created two _standalone_
tutorials:
[drag-and-drop](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-alpine.js/blob/main/drag-and-drop.md)
and 
[cursor-tracking](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-realtime-cursor-tracking-tutorial)
which detail the mechanics of dragging and dropping `items`
and cursor tracking across browsers/devices.
If you are totally new to drag-and-drop,
we suggest following at least that one for full context.
