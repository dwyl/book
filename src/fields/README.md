A **complete beginner's guide**
to building a **`Phoenix` Web App**
using **`fields`**
to **_appropriately_ store personal data**.

# TODO: insert screenshot of working `fields-demo` app.

## Why?

Building secure web applications 
that respect people's privacy
by considerately storing 
personal data
is an _essential_ skill.

Most beginner's guides
gloss over the steps 
we are about to take together.
If you care about your _own_ privacy - and you should! -
don't skip this chapter.

## What?

The `fields-demo` App
showcases a **registration form**
for a (ficticious) conference
"Awesome Conf".
It shows you all the steps necessary
to build the form
using the `fields` package
to securely store personal data.

## Who?

This guide is for anyone 
wanting a rigorous approach
to building an App 
that collects/stores personal data.
