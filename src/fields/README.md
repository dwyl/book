## Why?

Building secure web applications 
that respect people's privacy
by considerately storing 
personal data
is an _essential_ skill.

Most beginner's guides
gloss over the steps 
we are about to take together.
If you care about your _own_ privacy - and you should! -
don't skip this chapter.

## What?

The `fields-demo` App
showcases a **registration form**
for a (fictitious) conference called "**_Awesome_ Conf**".
It shows you all the steps necessary
to build the form
using the `fields` package
to securely store personal data.

## Who?

This guide is for anyone 
wanting a rigorous approach
to building an App 
that collects/stores personal data.

## How?

Let's get started by setting up the `Phoenix` project!
