## Why?

Building secure web applications 
that respect people's privacy
by considerately storing 
personal data
is an _essential_ skill.

Most beginner's guides
gloss over the steps 
we are about to take together.
If you care about your _own_ privacy - and you should! -
follow along 
and see how _easy_ it is to do the _right_ thing.

### Why Build This Demo App _First_? 

Simple: to showcase how straightforward it is
to transparently validate, encrypt and decrypt 
sensitive personal data
in an ultra-basic but fully-functional web app. 

We will then _use_ these techniques
to build something more advanced.

## What?

The **`fields-demo`** App
showcases a **registration form**
for a (fictitious) conference called "**_Awesome_ Conf**".

It covers all the steps necessary
to build the form
using the `fields` package
to securely store personal data.

## Who?

This guide is for anyone 
wanting a rigorous approach
to building an App 
that collects/stores personal data.

## How?

Let's get started by setting up the `Phoenix` project!
