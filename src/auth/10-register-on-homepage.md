# Register / Login 

After running `mix phx.gen.auth` 
in the previous step 
the homepage 
of the project
looks like this:

The addition 
of the **`Register`** and **`Log in`**
links in the top-right of the screen
allow us to select one of those two actions.

## Register: [localhost:4000/people/register](http://localhost:4000/people/register)

## Log in: [localhost:4000/people/log_in](http://localhost:4000/people/log_in)

There's a _lot_ of clutter 
and too many words 
on these two pages:

The copywriter cannot decide 
if they want us to 
**`Log in`** or **`Sign in`**.
And why is it an **`account`**?
is this a Bank? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Rather than focussing on these two pages,
we are instead going to build our `auth` 
page from scratch.
Behind the scenes we will reuse 
some functions generated by `phx.gen.auth`.
But ultimately we will ***`delete`***
_most_ of it. 

Open the
`lib/auth_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`
file and **`delete`** _all_ of the contents. ‚úÇÔ∏è
