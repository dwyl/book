# Database Schema Review

If you prefer to start with a blank slate,
feel free to skip this page.

Final snapshot of diagram:

Without much knowledge of database schemas, 
if you just pay _close_ attention, 
you'll see that that the **`person_id`** relationship  (**`foreign key`**)
is not correctly defined on 3 tables: **`apikeys`**, **`apps`** and **`roles`**.

This has caused me/us no end of pain while trying to add new features ... 
[auth/pull/231](https://github.com/dwyl/auth/pull/231#issuecomment-1345762532)

So, in _addition_ to _dramatically_ simplifying the database schema, 
I will make sure that all the `Ecto` relationships are well-defined 
so that we don't run into annoying constraint errors in the future.

If we _start_ by deleting the tables that we don't _need_, we _immediately_ simplify the ERD:

If we manually edit the diagram to include the `person_id` links (foreign keys):

It becomes clearer what data "belongs" to a `person`. 
But we can immediately spot something that incomplete/incorrect:
***who*** does a `group` "belong" to? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Obviously it's "unfair" to pick holes in a feature that is incomplete.
But it's "broken" and we (I) need to learn from it. üí≠
