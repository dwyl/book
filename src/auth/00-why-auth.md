# Why _Custom_ Build Auth?

After a couple of decades of writing code
and _studying_ 30+ CMS/Frameworks 
& Enterprise Auth providers
we concluded 
that all the Authentication/Authorization
systems are still _way_ too complex
and required too many steps.
Rather than lock ourselves into 
something complex and then 
be stuck with slow/no progress,
we decided to build something from scratch
that would allow us to **move _much_ faster**.

We have documented _all_ the steps taken
in creating our `auth` system
in this book.
The code is well documented, tested and maintained.

We _encourage_ anyone interested
in _understanding_ 
how things work behind the scenes
to read through the `auth` chapters.
However we know this is not the most _exciting_ 
part of the stack. 

If you prefer to skip the `auth` section entirely,
you can just _use_ it 
and treat it as a "service" that "just works"
and only refer to specific parts when needed.
