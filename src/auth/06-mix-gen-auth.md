# Generate Auth Files

The `phx.gen.auth` "generator" 
creates a bunch of code 
see:
[hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth.html)

```sh
mix phx.gen.auth Accounts Person people
```

We will treat this code as "scaffolding" 
and `delete` some of the unused code along the way.
