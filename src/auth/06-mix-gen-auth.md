# Generate Auth Files

For `auth v2`  
we are using the `phx.gen.auth` "generator" 
to provide some of the scaffolding
and session management.
see:
[hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth.html)

In your terminal, run th following command:

```sh
mix phx.gen.auth Accounts Person people
```

The generator prompts with the following question:

```sh

```


and `delete` some of the unused code along the way.
