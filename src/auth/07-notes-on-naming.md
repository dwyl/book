# Notes on Naming Conventions

![iamnotauser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/223168289-b44149c8-56da-4348-8561-4f9904007f72.png)

The words we use matter.
To some people they matter _more_ 
than the _message_ we are trying to convey.
For some, if you speak or write
a word that offends them (or _anyone_ else),
what you have to say is no longer relevant.

There are _many_ words we avoid using
in polite company such as 
[profanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity)
and others we attempt to eliminate completely such as 
[pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) terms
or 
[ethnic slurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs).


## ~~User~~ -> `Person`

The word "**user**" is pervasive in computing:

> "_A **`user`** is a **`person`** 
> who utilizes a computer or network service._"
> ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)#Terminology

![wikipedia-user-computer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/223142338-11395ebc-2506-4114-895e-2051dcf8031f.png)

Right there in the _definition_
they clarify that a "user" is a "person" ...
so why not just call them a `person`? 

The fact that the term "**user**" is widely used
doesn't make it _right_; 
it's just the `default` word
many people have become accustomed to.

Mega tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook
regularly use the word "user" or "users"
to describe the **`people`** that use their products and services.

## Personalization?

Consider the word **`personalization`**.
"_**Personalization** consists of tailoring 
a service or a product 
to accommodate specific individuals, 
sometimes tied to groups or segments of individuals_."
~ [wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization)

The word isn't "userization",
because the interface for the "user" is always the same; generic.
Whereas the interface that is personalized 
to an individual person is _just_ for them.

We will be doing a _lot_ of **`personalization`**
in our `App`
and building tools that allow `people`
to personalize their _own_ experience. 

## Complete Clarity

We avoid using the word "***user***"
in the `auth` system and our `App`
because we consider it reductive
and distances the `people` creating the `code`
from the `people` _using_ the product.

Instead we refer to `people` using the `App`
as `people` because it helps us 
to _think_ of them as **_real_ `people`**.

We cannot _force_ anyone `else`
to stop using the word "user".
It will still be the `default` for many companies.

[`Facebook`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-react/issues/23#issuecomment-406784935)
will continue referring to `people` as "users"
and more specifically 
"[**MAUs**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-react/issues/23#issuecomment-1458429682)"
(Monthly Active Users).
They don't _want_ to think about the 
`people` whose lives they are 
[wasting](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/29).

We want to do the _exact_ opposite of `Facebook` with our `App`;
we want to **help `people` _save_ time**!
So we are using the word "people"
and avoiding "users" wherever we can.

> "_Simply put, the U-words have their origin in a more sanguine, naïve era. 
As terms, I find them unethical and outdated, 
and so I have doubts they can usher in 
the kind of improvements to technology we desperately need._"
