# Intro 

Our aim with writing a book 
is to **_comprehensively_ document**
**_everything_ we learned** 
while building our 
[**`App`**](https://github.com/dwyl/app)
and 
**`API`**.

This is the 
[**handbook**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook)
we _wish_ we had 
when we started our journey.
Our goal is to have a book 
that _anyone_ can use 
to learn _exactly_ how we build/built
_every_ aspect of our `App`. 

We have already written over 
**100 stand-alone tutorials**
for various technologies/tools/frameworks.
See:
[dwyl?q=**learn**](https://github.com/dwyl?q=learn) <br />
The _advantage_ of 
standalone/self-contained tutorials
is that they are _focussed_ 
on one thing.
The disadvantage 
is that they lack clear progression.
So people can be left asking:
"**What _next_**?"
By contrast the objective in the `book`
is to have a **_very_ clear progression**.

You can save a PDF copy of the book 
and read it ***offline*** in your own time
without any distractions.
Of if you have good internet,
you can follow along 
and _build_ the `App` step-by-step.

One day, _all_ software will be Open Source.
This is our small contribution to that end.

If you agree with the idea
that software should be Open to _anyone_,
please let us know! üôè
"Star" the repo on `GitHub`

With that out of the way,
let's get started learning by _doing_! üöÄ
