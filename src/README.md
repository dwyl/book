# Intro

Our aim with writing a book 
is to **_comprehensively_ document**
everything we learned 
while building our `App`
and `API`.

This is the **`handbook`** 
we _wish_ we had 
when we started our journey.
We want to capture 
as _much_ as possible 
so that _anyone_ 

We have already written over 
**100 stand-alone tutorials**
[dwyl?q=**learn**](https://github.com/dwyl?q=learn)
for various technologies/tools/frameworks.
The _advantage_ of 
standalone/self-contained tutorials
is that they are focussed 
on one thing.
The disadvantage 
is that they lack clear progression.
By contrast the objective in the `book`
is to have a **_very_ clear progression**.

Our goal is to have a book 
that anyone can use 
to learn _exactly_ how we build/built
_any_ aspect of our `App`.

You can save a PDF copy of the book 
and read it offline in your own time.

One day, _all_ software will be Open Source.
This is our small contribution to that end.
