## What (*Software*) Testing is *Not*...!

![Software testing is not an exam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/216993375-ff5e23a4-ddfc-4fe2-b1ba-273452fd3c04.png "Software Testing is NOT an Exam!")

Some people have a natural aversion to the *idea* of testing because the *word* reminds them having to do exams in *formal education* (*especially those of us who* [***suffered***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lyURyVz7k) *from the experience!*)

![Don't Panic!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/216993090-5684a810-4ae4-415f-8eb3-a844146e9fa6.png "Don't Panic!")

***Don't Panic***! Writing tests for your Web Application is on the opposite end of the *Fun* Spectrum from multiple choice tests we all know (*and loathe*!)

## No Tests? ... *We Can Fix That*!

There are a number of "*reasons*" (*excuses*!) why people/teams/organizations *still* don't test their work.  
Take your pick from the following:

- "*We don't have time to write tests, we just need to get this done Yesterday!*"
- "*Testing takes too long and means we won't deliver as many features...*"
- "*Its just a small fix, we don't need to write a test*..."
- "*I'm a developer, I don't write tests, we need to hire a tester...*"
- "*If I write a test for every bit of code, then I have to update the tests when I need to change the code, so it's twice as much work...*"

and, last but not least:

- "*That's the way we have always done it here...*"

As a comparison, 
[***`Nokia 8110`***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8110) 
is how Mobile Phones looked in the 90's ... 
How many people do you still see carrying "*The Matrix Phone*" 
(*which was all-the-rage in 1999*) *today*?

We have better phones; shouldn't we also have better software engineering methods?

## Cowboy Coders?

![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We have all met a *Cowboy Coder* ... 
The "*I just get things done*"
developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
exclaims: "*I don't have time to write tests*" 
or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" 
and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: 
"*it was working this morning*" ... 
***Please share this*** with them and help them see the light!

## Code Without Test === Building Without Foundation!

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!
One of the things you

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But, ***without tests reliability is impossible***.

## *Say No to Untested Software (Web/Apps)!*

The days of poor quality software are *numbered*; people who continue to expect *inconsistent results* to be rewarded are in for a "*surprise*"!

This book is our effort to *accelerate* the process towards ending un-tested software!
We invite *you* to be part of the ***TQM Software*** *movement* and bring all your friends/colleagues!
